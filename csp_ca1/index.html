    <h1>Microsoft</h1>
    <p><strong>Microsoft Corporation</strong> is an American multinational technology corporation which produces
        computer software, consumer electronics, personal computers, and related services. Its best-known software
        products are the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, the Microsoft Office suite, and the Internet
        Explorer and Edge web browsers. Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles and the
        Microsoft Surface lineup of touchscreen personal computers. Microsoft ranked No. 21 in the 2020 Fortune 500
        rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue;<sup>[3]</sup> it was the world's largest
        software maker by revenue as of 2016.<sup>[4]</sup> It is one of the Big Five American information technology
        companies, alongside Google, Amazon, Apple, and Meta.</p>
    <p>Microsoft (the word being a portmanteau of "microcomputer software"<sup>[5]</sup>) was founded by Bill Gates and
        Paul Allen on April 4, 1975, to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800. It rose to dominate the
        personal computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by Microsoft Windows. The
        company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO), and subsequent rise in its share price, created three billionaires
        and an estimated 12,000 millionaires among Microsoft employees. Since the 1990s, it has increasingly diversified
        from the operating system market and has made a number of corporate acquisitions, their largest being the
        acquisition of LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in December 2016,<sup>[6]</sup> followed by their acquisition of Skype
        Technologies for $8.5 billion in May 2011.<sup>[7]</sup></p>
    <p>As of 2015, Microsoft is market-dominant in the IBM PC compatible operating system market and the office software
        suite market, although it has lost the majority of the overall operating system market to Android.<sup>[8]</sup>
        The company also produces a wide range of other consumer and enterprise software for desktops, laptops, tabs,
        gadgets, and servers, including Internet search (with Bing), the digital services market (through MSN), mixed
        reality (HoloLens), cloud computing (Azure), and software development (Visual Studio).</p>
    <p>Steve Ballmer replaced Gates as CEO in 2000, and later envisioned a "devices and services"
        strategy.<sup>[9]</sup> This unfolded with Microsoft acquiring Danger Inc. in 2008,<sup>[10]</sup> entering the
        personal computer production market for the first time in June 2012 with the launch of the Microsoft Surface
        line of tablet computers, and later forming Microsoft Mobile through the acquisition of Nokia's devices and
        services division. Since Satya Nadella took over as CEO in 2014, the company has scaled back on hardware and has
        instead focused on cloud computing, a move that helped the company's shares reach its highest value since
        December 1999.<sup>[11][12]</sup></p>
    <p>Earlier dethroned by Apple in 2010, in 2018 Microsoft reclaimed its position as the most valuable publicly traded
        company in the world.<sup>[13]</sup> In April 2019, Microsoft reached the trillion-dollar market cap, becoming
        the third U.S. public company to be valued at over $1 trillion after Apple and Amazon
        respectively.<sup>[14]</sup> As of 2020, Microsoft has the third-highest global brand valuation.<sup>[15]</sup>
