        <h1>Microsoft</h1>
        <div class="separator2"></div>
        <p><strong>Microsoft Corporation</strong> is an American multinational technology corporation which produces
            computer software, consumer electronics, personal computers, and related services. Its best-known software
            products are the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, the Microsoft Office suite, and the Internet
            Explorer and Edge web browsers. Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles and the
            Microsoft Surface lineup of touchscreen personal computers. Microsoft ranked No. 21 in the 2020 Fortune 500
            rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue;<sup>[3]</sup> it was the world's
            largest
            software maker by revenue as of 2016.<sup>[4]</sup> It is one of the Big Five American information
            technology
            companies, alongside Google, Amazon, Apple, and Meta.</p>

        <p>Microsoft (the word being a portmanteau of "microcomputer software"<sup>[5]</sup>) was founded by Bill Gates
            and
            Paul Allen on April 4, 1975, to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800. It rose to dominate
            the
            personal computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by Microsoft Windows. The
            company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO), and subsequent rise in its share price, created three
            billionaires
            and an estimated 12,000 millionaires among Microsoft employees. Since the 1990s, it has increasingly
            diversified
            from the operating system market and has made a number of corporate acquisitions, their largest being the
            acquisition of LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in December 2016,<sup>[6]</sup> followed by their acquisition of
            Skype
            Technologies for $8.5 billion in May 2011.<sup>[7]</sup></p>

        <p>As of 2015, Microsoft is market-dominant in the IBM PC compatible operating system market and the office
            software
            suite market, although it has lost the majority of the overall operating system market to
            Android.<sup>[8]</sup>
            The company also produces a wide range of other consumer and enterprise software for desktops, laptops,
            tabs,
            gadgets, and servers, including Internet search (with Bing), the digital services market (through MSN),
            mixed
            reality (HoloLens), cloud computing (Azure), and software development (Visual Studio).</p>

        <p>Steve Ballmer replaced Gates as CEO in 2000, and later envisioned a "devices and services"
            strategy.<sup>[9]</sup> This unfolded with Microsoft acquiring Danger Inc. in 2008,<sup>[10]</sup> entering
            the
            personal computer production market for the first time in June 2012 with the launch of the Microsoft Surface
            line of tablet computers, and later forming Microsoft Mobile through the acquisition of Nokia's devices and
            services division. Since Satya Nadella took over as CEO in 2014, the company has scaled back on hardware and
            has
            instead focused on cloud computing, a move that helped the company's shares reach its highest value since
            December 1999.<sup>[11][12]</sup></p>

        <p>Earlier dethroned by Apple in 2010, in 2018 Microsoft reclaimed its position as the most valuable publicly
            traded
            company in the world.<sup>[13]</sup> In April 2019, Microsoft reached the trillion-dollar market cap,
            becoming
            the third U.S. public company to be valued at over $1 trillion after Apple and Amazon
            respectively.<sup>[14]</sup> As of 2020, Microsoft has the third-highest global brand
            valuation.<sup>[15]</sup>

                <h5 id="1972">1972–1985: Founding</h5>

                <p>Childhood friends Bill Gates and Paul Allen sought to make a business using their skills in computer
                    programming.<sup>[17]</sup> In 1972, they founded Traf-O-Data, which sold a rudimentary computer to
                    track and analyze automobile traffic data. Gates enrolled at Harvard University while Allen pursued
                    a degree in
                    computer science at Washington State University, though he later dropped out to work at
                    Honeywell.<sup>[18]</sup>
                    The January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics featured Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems's
                    (MITS)
                    Altair 8800 microcomputer,<sup>[19]</sup> which inspired Allen to suggest that they could program a
                    BASIC
                    interpreter for the device. Gates called MITS and claimed that he had a working interpreter, and
                    MITS requested a
                    demonstration. Allen worked on a simulator for the Altair while Gates developed the interpreter, and
                    it
                    worked flawlessly when they demonstrated it to MITS in March 1975 in Albuquerque, New Mexico. MITS
                    agreed to
                    distribute it, marketing it as Altair BASIC.<sup>[16]: 108, 112–114 </sup> Gates and Allen
                    established Microsoft on
                    April 4, 1975, with Gates as CEO,<sup>[20]</sup> and Allen suggested the name "Micro-Soft", short
                    for
                    micro-computer software.<sup>[21][22]</sup> In August 1977, the company formed an agreement with
                    ASCII Magazine in

                <p>Microsoft entered the operating system (OS) business in 1980 with its own version of Unix called
                    Xenix,<sup>[24]</sup> but it was MS-DOS that solidified the company's dominance. IBM awarded a
                    contract to Microsoft in November
                    1980 to provide a version of the CP/M OS to be used in the IBM Personal Computer (IBM
                    PC).<sup>[25]</sup> For
                    this deal, Microsoft purchased a CP/M clone called 86-DOS from Seattle Computer Products which it
                    branded as
                    MS-DOS, although IBM rebranded it to IBM PC DOS. Microsoft retained ownership of MS-DOS following
                    the release of
                    the IBM PC in August 1981. IBM had copyrighted the IBM PC BIOS, so other companies had to reverse
                    engineer it in
                    order for non-IBM hardware to run as IBM PC compatibles, but no such restriction applied to the
                    operating
                    systems. Microsoft eventually became the leading PC operating systems
                    vendor.<sup>[26][27]: 210 </sup> The
                    company expanded into new markets with the release of the Microsoft Mouse in 1983, as well as with a
                    publishing
                    division named Microsoft Press.<sup>[16]: 232 </sup> Paul Allen resigned from Microsoft in 1983
                    after developing
                    Hodgkin's disease.<sup>[28]</sup> Allen claimed in Idea Man: A Memoir by the Co-founder of Microsoft
                    that Gates wanted to dilute his share in the company when he was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease
                    because he did
                    not think that he was working hard enough.<sup>[29]</sup> Allen later invested in low-tech sectors,
                    sports teams,
                    commercial real estate, neuroscience, private space flight, and more.<sup>[30]</sup></p>

                <p>Microsoft released Microsoft Windows on November 20, 1985, as a graphical extension for
                    MS-DOS,<sup>[16]: 242–243, 246 </sup> despite having begun jointly developing OS/2 with IBM the
                    previous
                    August.<sup>[31]</sup>
                    Microsoft moved its headquarters from Bellevue to Redmond, Washington, on February 26, 1986, and
                    went
                    public on March 13,<sup>[32]</sup> with the resulting rise in stock making an estimated four
                    billionaires and
                    12,000 millionaires from Microsoft employees.<sup>[33]</sup> Microsoft released its version of OS/2
                    to original equipment
                    manufacturers (OEMs) on April 2, 1987.<sup>[16]</sup> In 1990, the Federal Trade Commission examined
                    Microsoft for possible
                    collusion due to the partnership with IBM, marking the beginning of more than a decade of legal
                    clashes with the
                    government.<sup>[34]: 243–244 </sup> Meanwhile, the company was at work on Microsoft Windows NT,
                    which was heavily based
                    on their copy of the OS/2 code. It shipped on July 21, 1993, with a new modular kernel and the
                    32-bit Win32 application
                    programming interface (API), making it easier to port from 16-bit (MS-DOS-based) Windows. Microsoft
                    informed
                    IBM of Windows NT, and the OS/2 partnership deteriorated.<sup>[35]</sup></p>

                <p>On July 27, 1994, the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division filed a competitive impact statement
                    which said: "Beginning in 1988 and continuing until July 15, 1994, Microsoft induced many OEMs to
                    execute
                    anti-competitive 'per processor' licenses. Under a per-processor license, an OEM pays Microsoft a
                    royalty for each computer it sells containing a particular microprocessor, whether the OEM sells the
                    computer with a
                    Microsoft operating system or a non-Microsoft operating system. In effect, the royalty payment to
                    Microsoft when no Microsoft product is being used acts as a penalty, or tax, on the OEM's use of a
                    competing PC
                    operating system. Since 1988, Microsoft's use of per processor licenses has
                    increased."<sup>[39]</sup></p>

                <p>Following Bill Gates' internal "Internet Tidal Wave memo" on May 26, 1995, Microsoft began to
                    redefine
                    its offerings and expand its product line into computer networking and the World Wide
                    Web.<sup>[40]</sup>
                    With a few exceptions of new companies, like Netscape, Microsoft was the only major and established
                    company that acted fast
                    enough to be a part of the World Wide Web practically from the start. Other companies like Borland,
                    WordPerfect,
                    Novell, IBM and Lotus, being much slower to adapt to the new situation, would give Microsoft a
                    market
                    dominance.<sup>[41]</sup>
                    The company released Windows 95 on August 24, 1995, featuring pre-emptive multitasking, a completely
                    new
                    user interface with a novel start button, and 32-bit compatibility; similar to NT, it provided the
                    Win32
                    API.<sup>[42][43]: 20 </sup> Windows 95 came bundled with the online service MSN, which was at first
                    intended to be a competitor to the Internet,[dubious – discuss] and (for OEMs) Internet Explorer, a
                    Web browser. Internet
                    Explorer was not bundled with the retail Windows 95 boxes, because the boxes were printed before the
                    team finished the Web browser, and instead was included in the Windows 95 Plus! pack.<sup>[44]</sup>
                    Backed
                    by a high-profile marketing campaign<sup>[45]</sup> and what The New York Times called "the
                    splashiest, most frenzied,
                    most expensive introduction of a computer product in the industry's history,"<sup>[46]</sup> Windows
                    95 quickly became
                    a success.<sup>[47]</sup>
                    Branching out into new markets in 1996, Microsoft and General Electric's NBC unit created a new 24/7
                    cable news channel, MSNBC.<sup>[48]</sup> Microsoft created Windows CE 1.0, a new OS designed for
                    devices with low
                    memory and other constraints, such as personal digital assistants.<sup>[49]</sup> In October 1997,
                    the Justice Department
                    filed a motion in the Federal District Court, stating that Microsoft violated an agreement signed in
                    1994 and asked the
                    court to stop the bundling of Internet Explorer with Windows.<sup>[16]: 323–324 </sup></p>

                    of
                    Gates and employee of the company since 1980, while creating a new position for himself as Chief
                    Software
                    Architect.<sup>[16]: 111, 228 [20]</sup> Various companies including Microsoft formed the Trusted
                    Computing Platform Alliance in October 1999 to (among other things) increase security and protect
                    intellectual property
                    through identifying changes in hardware and software. Critics decried the alliance as a way to
                    enforce
                    indiscriminate restrictions over how consumers use software, and over how computers behave, and as a
                    form of digital
                    rights management: for example the scenario where a computer is not only secured for its owner, but
                    also
                    secured against its owner as well.<sup>[50][51]</sup> On April 3, 2000, a judgment was handed down
                    in the case
                    of United States v.
                    Microsoft Corp.,<sup>[52]</sup> calling the company an "abusive monopoly."<sup>[53]</sup> Microsoft
                    later settled with the U.S.
                    Department of Justice in 2004.<sup>[32]</sup> On October 25, 2001, Microsoft released Windows XP,
                    unifying the mainstream and NT lines of OS under the NT codebase.<sup>[54]</sup> The company
                    released the Xbox later that year,
                    entering the video game console market dominated by Sony and Nintendo.<sup>[55]</sup> In March 2004
                    the European Union
                    brought antitrust legal action against the company, citing it abused its dominance with the Windows
                    OS, resulting in a judgment
                    of €497 million ($613 million) and requiring Microsoft to produce new versions of Windows XP without
                    Windows
                    Media Player: Windows XP Home Edition N and Windows XP Professional N.<sup>[56][57]</sup> In
                    November 2005,
                    the company's second video game console, the Xbox 360, was released. There were two versions, a
                    basic version for $299.99 and
                    a deluxe version for $399.99.<sup>[58]</sup></p>

                <p>Increasingly present in the hardware business following Xbox, Microsoft in 2006 released the Zune
                    series
                    of digital media players, a successor of its previous software platform Portable Media Center. These
                    expanded on previous hardware commitments from Microsoft following its original Microsoft Mouse in
                    1983; as of 2007
                    the company sold the best-selling wired keyboard (Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000), mouse
                    (IntelliMouse),
                    and desktop webcam (LifeCam) in the United States. That year the company also launched the Surface

                    Store opened in
                    Scottsdale, Arizona; the same day Windows 7 was officially released to the public. Windows 7's focus
                    was on refining
                    Vista with ease-of-use features and performance enhancements, rather than an extensive reworking of
                    Windows.<sup>[69][70][71]</sup></p>

                <p>>As the smartphone industry boomed in the late 2000s, Microsoft had struggled to keep up with its
                    rivals
                    in providing a modern smartphone operating system, falling behind Apple and Google-sponsored Android
                    in the
                    United States.<sup>[72]</sup> As a result, in 2010 Microsoft revamped their aging flagship mobile
                    operating
                    system, Windows Mobile, replacing it with the new Windows Phone OS that was released in October that
                    year. It used a new
                    user interface design language, codenamed "Metro", which prominently used simple shapes, typography
                    and
                    iconography, utilizing the concept of minimalism. Microsoft implemented a new strategy for the
                    software industry,
                    providing a consistent user experience across all smartphones using the Windows Phone OS. It
                    launched an alliance
                    with Nokia in 2011 and Microsoft worked closely with the company to co-develop Windows
                    Phone,<sup>[73]</sup> but
                    remained partners with long-time Windows Mobile OEM HTC.<sup>[74]</sup> Microsoft is a founding

                    for a cloud

                    since
                    1996.<sup>[85]</sup> On October 1, Microsoft announced its intention to launch a news operation,

                    the Microsoft Surface.<sup>[81][87]</sup> Three days later, Windows Phone 8 was
                    launched.<sup>[88]</sup> To cope with
                    the potential for an increase in demand for products and services, Microsoft opened a number of
                    "holiday stores" across the U.S. to
                    complement the increasing number of "bricks-and-mortar" Microsoft Stores that opened in

                <p>The Kinect, a motion-sensing input device made by Microsoft and designed as a video game controller,
                    first introduced in November 2010, was upgraded for the 2013 release of the Xbox One video game
                    console.
                    Kinect's capabilities were revealed in May 2013: an ultra-wide 1080p camera, function in the dark
                    due to an
                    infrared sensor, higher-end processing power and new software, the ability to distinguish between

                    (such as a thumb movement), and determining a user's heart rate by looking at their
                    face.<sup>[92]</sup>
                    Microsoft filed a patent application in 2011 that suggests that the corporation may use the Kinect
                    camera system to monitor the
                    behavior of television viewers as part of a plan to make the viewing experience more interactive. On

                <p>When Microsoft went public and launched its initial public offering (IPO) in 1986, the opening stock
                    price
                    was
                    $21; after the trading day, the price closed at $27.75. As of July 2010, with the company's nine
                    stock
                    splits,
                    any IPO shares would be multiplied by 288; if one were to buy the IPO today, given the splits and
                    other
                    factors,
                    it would cost about 9 cents.<sup>[16]: 235–236 [163][164]</sup> The stock price peaked in 1999 at
                    around
                    $119 ($60.928,
                    adjusting for splits).<sup>[165]</sup> The company began to offer a dividend on January 16, 2003,
                    starting
                    at eight cents
                    per share for the fiscal year followed by a dividend of sixteen cents per share the subsequent year,
                    switching
                    from yearly to quarterly dividends in 2005 with eight cents a share per quarter and a special
                    one-time
                    payout of
                    three dollars per share for the second quarter of the fiscal year.[165][166] Though the company had
                    subsequent
                    increases in dividend payouts, the price of Microsoft's stock remained steady for
                    years.<sup>[166][167]</sup></p>

                <p>Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service have both given a AAA rating to Microsoft, whose
                    assets
                    were
                    valued at $41 billion as compared to only $8.5 billion in unsecured debt. Consequently, in February
                    2011
                    Microsoft released a corporate bond amounting to $2.25 billion with relatively low borrowing rates
                    compared
                    to
                    government bonds.<sup>[168]</sup> For the first time in 20 years Apple Inc. surpassed Microsoft in
                    Q1
                    2011
                    quarterly
                    profits and revenues due to a slowdown in PC sales and continuing huge losses in Microsoft's Online
                    Services
                    Division (which contains its search engine Bing). Microsoft profits were $5.2 billion, while Apple
                    Inc.
                    profits
                    were $6 billion, on revenues of $14.5 billion and $24.7 billion respectively.<sup>[169]</sup>
                    Microsoft's
                    Online Services
                    Division has been continuously loss-making since 2006 and in Q1 2011 it lost $726 million. This
                    follows
                    a
                    loss
                    of $2.5 billion for the year 2010.<sup>[170]</sup></p>

                    On July 20, 2012, Microsoft posted its first quarterly loss ever, despite earning record revenues
                    for
                    the
                    quarter and fiscal year, with a net loss of $492 million due to a writedown related to the
                    advertising
                    company
                    aQuantive, which had been acquired for $6.2 billion back in 2007.<sup>[171]</sup> As of January

                    Microsoft's market

                    market
                    capitalization.<sup>[173]</sup> On November 14, 2014, Microsoft overtook ExxonMobil to become the

                    most-valuable
                    company by market capitalization, behind only Apple Inc. Its total market value was over $410B—with
                    the
                    stock
                    price hitting $50.04 a share, the highest since early 2000.<sup>[174]</sup> In 2015, Reuters
                    reported

                    Microsoft Corp
                    had earnings abroad of $76.4 billion which were untaxed by the Internal Revenue Service. Under U.S.

                <p>In November 2018, the company won a $480 million military contract with the U.S. government to bring
                    augmented
                    reality (AR) headset technology into the weapon repertoires of American soldiers. The two-year
                    contract
                    may
                    result in follow-on orders of more than 100,000 headsets, according to documentation describing the
                    bidding
                    process. One of the contract's tag lines for the augmented reality technology seems to be its
                    ability to
                    enable
                    "25 bloodless battles before the 1st battle", suggesting that actual combat training is going to be

                <p>Microsoft is an international business. As such, it needs subsidiaries present in whatever national

                    it
                    chooses to harvest. An example is Microsoft Canada, which it established in 1985.<sup>[178]</sup>
                    Other
                    countries have
                    similar installations, to funnel profits back up to Redmond and to distribute the dividends to the
                    holders

                <h5 id="Marketing">Marketing</h5>

                <p>In 2004, Microsoft commissioned research firms to do independent studies comparing the total cost of
                    ownership
                    (TCO) of Windows Server 2003 to Linux; the firms concluded that companies found Windows easier to
                    administrate
                    than Linux, thus those using Windows would administrate faster resulting in lower costs for their
                    company
                    (i.e.
                    lower TCO).<sup>[179]</sup> This spurred a wave of related studies; a study by the Yankee Group
                    concluded
                    that upgrading
                    from one version of Windows Server to another costs a fraction of the switching costs from Windows
                    Server to
                    Linux, although companies surveyed noted the increased security and reliability of Linux servers and
                    concern
                    about being locked into using Microsoft products.<sup>[180]</sup> Another study, released by the
                    Open
                    Source
                    Development
                    Labs, claimed that the Microsoft studies were "simply outdated and one-sided" and their survey
                    concluded
                    that
                    the TCO of Linux was lower due to Linux administrators managing more servers on average and other
                    reasons.<sup>[181]</sup>

                    had
                    developed in partnership with Accenture for the London Stock Exchange, claiming that it provided

                    nines"
                    reliability. After suffering extended downtime and unreliability<sup>[182][183]</sup> the London
                    Stock
                    Exchange announced
                    in 2009 that it was planning to drop its Microsoft solution and switch to a Linux-based one in

                <p>In 2012, Microsoft hired a political pollster named Mark Penn, whom The New York Times called "famous
                    for
                    bulldozing" his political opponents<sup>[186]</sup> as Executive Vice-president, Advertising and
                    Strategy.
                    Penn created a
                    series of negative advertisements targeting one of Microsoft's chief competitors, Google. The
                    advertisements,
                    called "Scroogled", attempt to make the case that Google is "screwing" consumers with search results
                    rigged
                    to
                    favor Google's paid advertisers, that Gmail violates the privacy of its users to place ad results

                    the
                    content of their emails and shopping results, which favor Google products. Tech publications like
                    TechCrunch

                <h5 id="Layoffs">Layoffs</h5>

                <p>In July 2014, Microsoft announced plans to lay off 18,000 employees. Microsoft employed 127,104
                    people as
                    of
                    June
                    5, 2014, making this about a 14 percent reduction of its workforce as the biggest Microsoft lay off
                    ever.
                    This
                    included 12,500 professional and factory personnel. Previously, Microsoft had eliminated 5,800 jobs
                    in
                    2009
                    in
                    line with the Great Recession of 2008–2017.<sup>[189][190]</sup> In September 2014, Microsoft laid
                    off
                    2,100
                    people,
                    including 747 people in the Seattle–Redmond area, where the company is headquartered. The firings
                    came
                    as a
                    second wave of the layoffs that were previously announced. This brought the total number to over
                    15,000
                    out
                    of
                    the 18,000 expected cuts.<sup>[191]</sup> In October 2014, Microsoft revealed that it was almost
                    done
                    with
                    the elimination
                    of 18,000 employees, which was its largest-ever layoff sweep.<sup>[192]</sup> In July 2015,
                    Microsoft
                    announced another
                    7,800 job cuts in the next several months.<sup>[193]</sup> In May 2016, Microsoft announced another
                    1,850
                    job cuts mostly
                    in its Nokia mobile phone division. As a result, the company will record an impairment and

                <p>Microsoft provides information about reported bugs in their software to intelligence agencies of the
                    United
                    States government, prior to the public release of the fix. A Microsoft spokesperson has stated that
                    the
                    corporation runs several programs that facilitate the sharing of such information with the U.S.
                    government.<sup>[195]</sup>
                    Following media reports about PRISM, NSA's massive electronic surveillance program, in May 2013,
                    several
                    technology companies were identified as participants, including Microsoft.<sup>[196]</sup> According
                    to
                    leaks of said
                    program, Microsoft joined the PRISM program in 2007.<sup>[197]</sup> However, in June 2013, an
                    official
                    statement from
                    Microsoft flatly denied their participation in the program:</p>

                <p>"We provide customer data only when we receive a legally binding order or subpoena to do so, and
                    never on
                    a
                    voluntary basis. In addition we only ever comply with orders for requests about specific accounts or
                    identifiers. If the government has a broader voluntary national security program to gather customer
                    data, we
                    don't participate in it."<sup>[198]</sup></p>

                <p>During the first six months in 2013, Microsoft had received requests that affected between 15,000 and
                    15,999
                    accounts.<sup>[199]</sup> In December 2013, the company made statement to further emphasize the fact
                    that
                    they take their
                    customers' privacy and data protection very seriously, even saying that "government snooping
                    potentially
                    now
                    constitutes an 'advanced persistent threat,' alongside sophisticated malware and cyber
                    attacks".<sup>[200]</sup> The
                    statement also marked the beginning of three-part program to enhance Microsoft's encryption and
                    transparency
                    efforts. On July 1, 2014, as part of this program they opened the first (of many) Microsoft
                    Transparency
                    Center,
                    that provides "participating governments with the ability to review source code for our key
                    products,
                    assure
                    themselves of their software integrity, and confirm there are no "back doors."<sup>[201]</sup>
                    Microsoft
                    has
                    also argued
                    that the United States Congress should enact strong privacy regulations to protect consumer
                    data.<sup>[202]</sup></p>

                <p>In April 2016, the company sued the U.S. government, arguing that secrecy orders were preventing the
                    company
                    from
                    disclosing warrants to customers in violation of the company's and customers' rights. Microsoft
                    argued
                    that
                    it
                    was unconstitutional for the government to indefinitely ban Microsoft from informing its users that
                    the
                    government was requesting their emails and other documents, and that the Fourth Amendment made it so
                    people
                    or
                    businesses had the right to know if the government searches or seizes their property. On October 23,
                    2017,
                    Microsoft said it would drop the lawsuit as a result of a policy change by the United States

                    of
                    Justice (DoJ). The DoJ had "changed data request rules on alerting the Internet users about agencies

                <p>The corporate headquarters, informally known as the Microsoft Redmond campus, is located at One
                    Microsoft
                    Way
                    in
                    Redmond, Washington. Microsoft initially moved onto the grounds of the campus on February 26, 1986,
                    weeks
                    before
                    the company went public on March 13. The headquarters has since experienced multiple expansions
                    since
                    its
                    establishment. It is estimated to encompass over 8 million ft2 (750,000 m2) of office space and
                    30,000–40,000
                    employees.<sup>[226]</sup> Additional offices are located in Bellevue and Issaquah, Washington
                    (90,000
                    employees
                    worldwide). The company is planning to upgrade its Mountain View, California, campus on a grand
                    scale.
                    The
                    company has occupied this campus since 1981. In 2016, the company bought the 32-acre (13 ha) campus,
                    with
                    plans
                    to renovate and expand it by 25%.<sup>[227]</sup> Microsoft operates an East Coast headquarters in
                    Charlotte, North

                <p>On October 26, 2015, the company opened its retail location on Fifth Avenue in New York City. The
                    location
                    features a five-story glass storefront and is 22,270 square feet.<sup>[229]</sup> As per company
                    executives,
                    Microsoft had
                    been on the lookout for a flagship location since 2009.<sup>[230]</sup> The company's retail
                    locations
                    are
                    part of a
                    greater strategy to help build a connection with its consumers. The opening of the store coincided
                    with
                    the
                    launch of the Surface Book and Surface Pro 4.<sup>[231]</sup> On November 12, 2015, Microsoft opened
                    a
                    second flagship
                    store, located in Sydney's Pitt Street Mall.<sup>[232]</sup></p>

                <h5 id="Logo">Logo</h5>

                <p>Microsoft adopted the so-called "Pac-Man Logo," designed by Scott Baker, in 1987. Baker stated "The
                    new
                    logo,
                    in
                    Helvetica italic typeface, has a slash between the o and s to emphasize the "soft" part of the name
                    and
                    convey
                    motion and speed."<sup>[233]</sup> Dave Norris ran an internal joke campaign to save the old logo,
                    which
                    was
                    green, in all
                    uppercase, and featured a fanciful letter O, nicknamed the blibbet, but it was
                    discarded.<sup>[234]</sup>
                    Microsoft's logo
                    with the tagline "Your potential. Our passion."—below the main corporate name—is based on a slogan
                    Microsoft
                    used in 2008. In 2002, the company started using the logo in the United States and eventually
                    started a
                    television campaign with the slogan, changed from the previous tagline of "Where do you want to go
                    today?"<sup>[235][236][237]</sup> During the private MGX (Microsoft Global Exchange) conference in
                    2010,
                    Microsoft unveiled
                    the company's next tagline, "Be What's Next."<sup>[238]</sup> They also had a slogan/tagline "Making

                <p>On August 23, 2012, Microsoft unveiled a new corporate logo at the opening of its 23rd Microsoft

                    Boston,
                    indicating the company's shift of focus from the classic style to the tile-centric modern interface,
                    which
                    it
                    uses/will use on the Windows Phone platform, Xbox 360, Windows 8 and the upcoming Office
                    Suites.<sup>[240]</sup> The new
                    logo also includes four squares with the colors of the then-current Windows logo which have been
                    used to
                    represent Microsoft's four major products: Windows (blue), Office (red), Xbox (green) and Bing
                    (yellow).<sup>[241]</sup>
                    The logo also resembles the opening of one of the commercials for Windows 95.<sup>[242][243]</sup>

                <h5 id="Controversies">Controversies</h5>

                <p>Criticism of Microsoft has followed various aspects of its products and business practices.
                    Frequently
                    criticized
                    are the ease of use, robustness, and security of the company's software. They've also been
                    criticized
                    for
                    the
                    use of permatemp employees (employees employed for years as "temporary," and therefore without
                    medical
                    benefits), the use of forced retention tactics, which means that employees would be sued if they
                    tried
                    to
                    leave.<sup>[247]</sup> Historically, Microsoft has also been accused of overworking employees, in
                    many
                    cases, leading to
                    burnout within just a few years of joining the company. The company is often referred to as a
                    "Velvet
                    Sweatshop", a term which originated in a 1989 Seattle Times article,<sup>[248]</sup> and later
                    became
                    used
                    to describe the
                    company by some of Microsoft's own employees.<sup>[249]</sup> This characterization is derived from
                    the
                    perception that
                    Microsoft provides nearly everything for its employees in a convenient place, but in turn overworks
                    them
                    to
                    a
                    point where it would be bad for their (possibly long-term) health.</p>

                <p>As reported by several news outlets,<sup>[250][251]</sup> an Irish subsidiary of Microsoft based in
                    the
                    Republic of Ireland
                    declared £220 bn in profits but paid no corporation tax for the year 2020. This is due to the
                    company
                    being
                    tax
                    resident in Bermuda as mentioned in the accounts for 'Microsoft Round Island One', a subsidiary that
                    collects
                    licence fees from the use of Microsoft software worldwide. Dame Margaret Hodge, a Labour MP in the
                    UK
                    said,
                    "It
                    is unsurprising – yet still shocking – that massively wealthy global corporations openly,
                    unashamedly
                    and
                    blatantly refuse to pay tax on the profits they make in the countries where they undertake
                    business".<sup>[251]</sup></p>

                <p>In 2020, ProPublica reported that the company had diverted more than $39 billion in U.S. profits to
                    Puerto
                    Rico
                    using a mechanism structured to make it seem as if the company was unprofitable on paper. As a
                    result,
                    the
                    company paid a tax rate on those profits of "nearly 0%." When the Internal Revenue Service audited
                    these
                    transactions, ProPublica reported that Microsoft aggressively fought back, including successfully
                    lobbying
                    Congress to change the law to make it harder for the agency to conduct audits of large
                    corporations.<sup>[252][253]</sup>

                <p>"Embrace, extend, and extinguish" (EEE),<sup>[254]</sup> also known as "embrace, extend, and
                    exterminate",<sup>[255]</sup> is a phrase
                    that the U.S. Department of Justice found<sup>[256]</sup> that was used internally by
                    Microsoft<sup>[257]</sup> to describe its
                    strategy for entering product categories involving widely used standards, extending those standards
                    with
                    proprietary capabilities, and then using those differences to strongly disadvantage competitors.
                    Microsoft
                    is
                    frequently accused of using anticompetitive tactics and abusing its monopolistic power. People who
                    use
                    their
                    products and services often end up becoming dependent on them, a process known as vendor lock-in.

                <p>Microsoft was the first company to participate in the PRISM surveillance program, according to leaked
                    NSA
                    documents obtained by The Guardian<sup>[258]</sup> and The Washington Post<sup>[259]</sup> in June

                    and
                    acknowledged by
                    government officials following the leak.<sup>[260]</sup> The program authorizes the government to
                    secretly
                    access data of
                    non-US citizens hosted by American companies without a warrant. Microsoft has denied participation
                    in
